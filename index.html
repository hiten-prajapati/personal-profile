                    <h1>Profile</h1>
                    <p>I am a seasoned IT Projects Lead at epay with 8+ yearsâ€™ experience in managing and delivering IT solutions for clients globally. My professional career began as an IT Operations Analyst, where I gained invaluable experience working with databases and applications, building a solid technical foundation that I have applied throughout my career. Additionally, I was responsible for client support and operations to ensure business continuity, equipping me with the skills to manage time-sensitive tasks and to prioritize effectively from an early stage in my career.</p>
                    <p>This foray into IT with a client focus motivated me to steer my career into the world of IT Project delivery where I could leverage the knowledge and skills gained in my previous role to deliver items of value for clients and be part of the bigger picture.</p>
                    <p>Fast-forward five years and I've ascended to the role of IT Projects Lead, entrusted with steering the most critical projects for epay, which includes shaping and strengthening our brand identity. In addition to this, I take on the role of a hands-on IT Project Manager for pivotal initiatives. Alongside these responsibilities, I dedicate myself to guiding and nurturing a talented team comprising IT Project Managers, Coordinators, and Product Operations specialists. What I enjoy the most of this role is the opportunity to engage directly in crafting our strategic direction, participating in crucial discussions, including key meetings with the C-suite during the discovery phase. Furthermore, I possess the autonomy to restructure and optimize the team's operations, ensuring peak efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
